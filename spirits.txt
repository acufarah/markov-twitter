I passed by the house and within I heard a noise. I stopped and listened,
and I heard screams. The voice sounded like that of a lady whom I once
knew. I was puzzled to know what to do, but finally decided to enter.
To my surprise, I did know the lady. I apologized for intruding, saying
that I was attracted by the terrible screams and thought I recognized the
voice.

The lady replied: “You are very kind, but I think I shall be able to
settle my trouble without your help.”

“I am very sorry, dear madam; I meant well,” I said.

I took my departure, yet I felt that I should not have done so under the
circumstances, for I knew that the talk the dear lady made was through
fear, as the master over her was standing near.

I was greatly depressed, because of the way in which I had left the place
of trouble. I had gone only a short distance when I decided to return. I
did so, and, to my surprise, I found the dear lady dead, as it is called.

I was horrified. The brute had fled. What was I to do? Go also and leave
the poor dead woman? I decided to do so. When at some distance from the
scene, I was hailed and confronted by the real murderer and an officer,
who accused me of the terrible crime.

What could I do? I knew that I was not guilty, but I failed to make the
officer believe it.

I was taken to jail because of the crime committed by the one who had me
arrested. But I had been seen coming from the house and I had dropped my
handkerchief while wiping the tears from my eyes.
